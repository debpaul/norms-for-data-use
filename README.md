# Species File Group Norms for Community, Data Use, and Publication

## Purpose

[This repository](https://github.com/debpaul/norms-for-data-use) contains the norms for community, data use, and publication for data publishers, data users, and anyone or group connected to the Species File Group community network.  These norms were adapted from the [Canadensys](http://www.canadensys.net) Norms for data use and publication, <http://www.canadensys.net/norms> and the derivative version [VertNet Norms](http://www.vertnet.org/resources/norms.html).

These norms are not a legal document. They are a well-considered code of conduct that anyone who engages in our broader network are expected to uphold. Your participation might involve joining community meetings and events, using TaxonWorks software, using Species File Group powered services such as our Application Progamming Interfaces (APIs), using our TaxonPages software, publishing data to or using data downloaded from SFG-related projects. Your adoption of these norms as part of your individual and community standards-of-practice contributes to building a thriving and evolving community. The intent is to support facilitating credit and attribution for work done, and recognition of expertise, in concert with efforts to make biodiversity data as complete, discoverable, and accessible as possible.
